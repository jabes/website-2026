                        <h3>Camping On Sunshine Coast</h3>
                        <p>First trip to Sunshine Coast. Found amazing land overlooking Agamemnon Channel. Hiked to Smuggler Cove, tried beaver calls. Nothing went to plan, which made it more memorable. Met friends on the ferry for bagged wine and wheelbarrow races on deck.</p>

                        <p>Old footage from 2011. We climbed Black Tusk's backside and hiked to Garibaldi Lake. 30km, 1,750m elevation gain in 11 hours, finishing in complete darkness. My most challenging hike to date. We should have worn helmets for that final climb.</p>
